Initially, the exhibition of works was presented on the territory of the Sochi Autodrom during the event. Now it is available to everyone in the Sochi Art Museum.<br/><br/>Formula 1 celebrates its 70th anniversary this year. The same number of artists took part in the project. The beautiful halls of the Sochi Art Museum showcase unusual works by artists from different cities of Russia, as well as Belarus, Bulgaria and Slovakia. The authors of the works tried to answer the question: "Why, even after 70 years, Formula 1 remains the queen of sports?"<br/><br/>BORIS SALAKHOV<br/>HEAD OF THE EXHIBITION DEPARTMENT OF THE SOCHINSK ART MUSEUM<br/>There are female artists who reveal a certain story literally or allegorically, what is happening there, some key characters in Formula 1. There are those who capture some moment that touched them and express the emotions that have arisen in the language of painting.<br/>Among the works presented should be noted the canvases of the artist from Rostov, who captured in his paintings a historical moment - the very first race in 1950. It is also curious to look at the work done in oil on a copper sheet. Unusual pictures immediately catch the eye. The works of artists from Slovakia deserve special attention.<br/><br/>DMITRY BARANOVSKY<br/>AUTHOR AND IDEOLOGIST OF THE "ROYAL RACING" PROJECT, GALLERIST<br/>And if last year we mainly had paintings that were painted in oils, then this time we took the graphics and it turned out to be very interesting. And there were many applications from artists who paint in the style of Dijital-Art. Therefore, some of the works were created in digital format, on a computer, and already for the exhibition we printed them on canvas, finished with oils and, accordingly, presented them to the audience.<br/>The exhibition hall also features unique collectibles - a helmet from the first Russian Grand Prix and an original Formula 1 pilot's suit.<br/>The Royal Races project aims to combine the emotions and beauty of motorsport with the power and expressiveness of painting. According to the organizer of the project Dmitry Baranovsky, the language of art is international and understandable to everyone, so the exhibition will be interesting not only for racing fans, but also for those who have never been to the stands of fans. Anyone can see the unique paintings until November 15 at the Sochi Art Museum.<br/></p>
